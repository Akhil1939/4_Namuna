## Student Progress Report & Analysis
<b> What is this all about?!</b>
<ul>
<li>Its our Design Engineering Project. That is basically an app which does the tasks like evaluating student's performance on the basis of Attendance, Exam Scores, Co-curricular Activities like Participation in some techfests, attending workshops and many more...
</li>
  <ul>
  As of now we're making simple structure of it as follows
    <li> Login credentials for Students, Faculties, Dean of the college</li>
    <li> Seprate Levels of abstractions for viewing details of Individual, Class, College</li>
    <li> Accept the data in terms of Forms so It'll be Structured Data </li>
    <li> Verify the certificates from the verification Link attached in Image</li>
    <li> Mark the Co-curricular Activities and add points to Student's Profile</li>
    <li> From the Structured Data, Predict the Analysis of Report of Individual </li>
    <li> From the separate level of Abstractions, View The Report to Individuals, Faculties, Deans</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li> <b> So that's what our project is about, You can also help me with the DataBase storing Knowledge or viewing it to Separate Levels</b> </li>
</ul>

# Thank You in Advance!
